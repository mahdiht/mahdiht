## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Mahdi HADJ TAIEB

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m in my final year of engineering at ENSTA Paris and also pursuing an M2 in Data Science at Ã‰cole Polytechnique.

ðŸ”¬ I recently completed a research internship at ENS Paris-Saclay (Centre Borelli), where I worked on temporal point processes and explored advanced modeling techniques.

ðŸ¤– Currently, Iâ€™m diving into the world of Generative AI, building projects and experimenting with cutting-edge models.

ðŸ’¡ Passionate about machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and AI applications, I enjoy turning complex ideas into practical solutions.

ðŸš€ Always curious, always learning.
